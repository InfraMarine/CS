Ten thousand years...
Demand Russ return
Fighting in the solitude
And he still waiting...

Ten thousand years...
The cub now became the Great Wolf
Through the immortals life
Lead the wolves to follow father's way...

From Terra...
Those drops of acid rain
Like Emperor's holy water
Blessing for the Astartes...

At Fenris...
White snow and branches
Turn into giant, softly bed
Waiting for Father Wolf and children returns...

That glorious body...
Now fall deep-stasis
Inside the full-armed Dreadnought...

But...
He never lost the hunter instinct
Since the Fall of Prospero
The legends still spread far away...

Thousand Sons of Magnus...
They must die by order of the Emperor and Horus
But that Order
Pushed the Wolves into endless war...

Between Wolves and Sorcerers...
Between Wulfen and Rubrick Marines
The Avenging Song echoing beyond times
What is left, just countless Innocent souls...

Russ, Bjorn, Magnus, Ahriman...
Primarchs and childrens...
Orchestrated by Dark Gods
Forever stuck in looping circle
Forever...
